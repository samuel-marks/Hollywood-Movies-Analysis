## Hello everyone!!!!!!
<i><b>Moviescopers</i></b> is an app that let you visualize the different patterns based on the data collected in regard to Hollywood of the past few years.

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access the different visualizations which are based on<b> Genre</b>,<b> Runtime</b> and<b> Release Day</b> concerning the<i> Gross % across the US and Overseas, Ratings, Profit in $(millions), Budget of the movies.</i> <br>
We also provide a feature to<b> Compare</b> multiple graphs for an easier analyis of data and also for a better transparency we have included an tab called <b>Movies Table</b> where you can have a look at the actual data based on which we have provided the visualizations.<br>
Below we have given some samples of the visualizations that you will see in the further in the app.
A quick walkthrough for the graphs that you see below:<br>
The<b> <span style="color:purple">purple</span></b> graph displays the number of movies produced by the respective<b> Studio </b>.<br>
The<b> <span style="color:orange">orange</span></b> graph shows the number of movies that belong to the respective <b> Genre </b>.<br>
Meanwhile the<b> <span style="color:red">mul</span><span style="color:green">tic</span><span style="color:blue">olor</span></b> graph is an interactive graph in which we have compared the <b> Ratings </b> of the two professional world famous movie critics namely <i>IMDb</i> and <i>Movielens</i>. The insight that we want to give you through this visualization is that <i>IMDb</i> tends to rate movies higher as compared to <i>Movielens</i> but the behaviour of the pattern of ratings is quite uniform.<br>
